# My IdeaVim config

[This](.ideavimrc) is my [IdeaVim](https://lp.jetbrains.com/ideavim/) config. [Vim](https://www.vim.org) is a language for working more efficiently in your IDE. IdeaVim is an integration to use Vim in JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ, Webstorm etc.

## Why do I post this here?
You have countless examples of vim configs out there. Though there's not that much of a community around vim in JetBrains IDEs. When I learn a new tool I like getting inspiration by seeing how others use it. So, this is my little contribution to provide a little IdeaVim inspiration.

## Setup
- Install [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim)
- [Create an .ideavimrc file](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-product-as-the-vim-editor.html#vimrc) 
- Copy the content of [my ideavimrc file](.ideavimrc) into yours if you want to try mine
- Check out [IdeaVim plugins](https://jb.gg/ideavim-plugins) for further configuration

This gives you a solid start to IdeaVim.
